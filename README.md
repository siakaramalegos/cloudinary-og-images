# Automatically generating social share images using Cloudinary

Did you ever notice those social media share images that automatically pop up for a site and think to yourself, "wow, it would be really cool if I could get that set up for my blog"? In this talk, Sia will show you how she uses 11ty shortcodes and Cloudinary to generate unique share images for each page and blog post on her site. (Cloudinary has a free tier that's generous enough that most personal sites fit under.)
